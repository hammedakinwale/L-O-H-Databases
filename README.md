# THE BRANCHES

## Git Branching Strategies:

+  Develop a Git branching strategy suitable for a multi-service application, ensuring seamless 
collaboration and integration with the CI/CD process.

Here's a refined Git branching strategy for a multi-service application, combining the best aspects of the previous suggestions and addressing potential areas for improvement:

__Mainline branch:__ A stable branch representing the production environment, typically named `main`

__Feature branches:__ Short-lived branches used for developing new features or fixing bugs, branched from `feature/` and merged back after completion.

__Release branches:__ Stable branches created from `release/` before releases, allowing testing and staging in a pre-production environment.

__Hotfix branches:__ Branches created from main to address critical production issues, merged back immediately or into a dedicated `hotfix`/ branch for management.

### HOTFIX BRANCH

It's a temporary branch created to urgently address critical issues in a production database without disrupting ongoing development. It's like a fast-track for repairs, ensuring stability and minimizing downtime.

### BUGFIX BRANCH

It's a temporary branch created to isolate and fix bugs in a database without disrupting the main codebase. Think of it as a dedicated workspace for bug repairs, ensuring stability and control.

### RELEASE BRANCH

A release branch in a database repository serves a specific purpose within the version control system, acting as a staging ground for upcoming database deployments.

### DEVELOPMENT:

A development branch in a database repository serves as a workspace for ongoing changes and improvements, separate from the stable production codebase. Think of it as an experimental zone where developers can freely work on new features, bug fixes, and optimizations without directly impacting the live database.
